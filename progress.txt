Of course. Here is a summary of the project that you can use to continue in a new chat.

**Project Summary:**

I am building a self-hosted inventory management system. The goal is to track items (like laptops), manage their users, condition, and transfer dates, and generate printable stickers with QR codes for each item.

**Current Technology Stack:**
* **Backend:** Node.js with the Express framework.
* **Database:** SQLite (self-hosted, file-based).
* **Frontend:** A single `index.html` file using Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

**Project Files:**
The project consists of four main files:
1.  `package.json`: Defines the project and its Node.js dependencies (`express`, `sqlite`, `sqlite3`, `cors`).
2.  `server.js`: The Express server that defines the API routes (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) for interacting with the inventory.
3.  `database.js`: A module that handles all the SQLite database operations (initializing the DB, creating the table, and running queries).
4.  `index.html`: The user interface for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting items.

**Key Features Implemented:**
* Adding new items to the inventory.
* Displaying a list of all inventory items.
* Deleting items from the list.
* A "Notes" field for each item.
* An "Edit" button that opens a modal to update an item's details.
* A "Sticker" button that generates a printable sticker with the item's details, a QR code, and a specific brand logo (`JARISK-Black.png`).
* The sticker layout has been refined multiple times to prevent text from overflowing or being misaligned.

**Current Status:**
We have just finished building the backend and connecting it to the frontend. The last feature we worked on was implementing the "update item" functionality, which involved creating a `PUT` route on the server and a corresponding edit form on the frontend. The most recent problem was a server error (`Cannot PUT /api/inventory/:id`) which was fixed by ensuring the `server.js` file contained the correct `app.put(...)` route definition.
